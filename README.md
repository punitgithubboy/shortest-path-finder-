Shortest Path Finder

A web application to visualize pathfinding algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* (A-Star) algorithm. This project provides an interactive grid interface to demonstrate how these algorithms work in finding the shortest path between two points while allowing users to customize the grid layout and traversal options.

Features

Visualization of Algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

A* (A-Star) Algorithm

Traversal Options:

Non-diagonal traversal

Diagonal traversal

Heuristics for A*:

Manhattan Distance

Diagonal Distance

Euclidean Distance

Interactive Grid:

Add walls (obstacles)

Define start and destination nodes

Visualize visited nodes and the final path

Reset Functionality: Clear walls and reset the grid.

How to Use

Open the application here.

Use the grid to define the Start Node (green) and Destination Node (blue).

Add Walls (black) to create obstacles by clicking on grid cells.

Select traversal options (diagonal or non-diagonal) and a heuristic for A*.

Click Visualize BFS or Visualize A-Star to see the algorithm in action.

Use the Clear Walls button to reset the grid.
