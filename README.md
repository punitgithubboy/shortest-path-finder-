Shortest Path Finder

A web application to visualize pathfinding algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* (A-Star) algorithm. This project provides an interactive grid interface to demonstrate how these algorithms work in finding the shortest path between two points while allowing users to customize the grid layout and traversal options.

**Features**

Pathfinding Algorithms:

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

A (A-Star)*

**Traversal Options:**

Non-diagonal or Diagonal

**A Heuristics*:**

Manhattan, Diagonal, or Euclidean Distance

**Interactive Grid:**

Add Walls (obstacles)

Define Start (green) and Destination (blue) nodes

Visualize visited nodes and the shortest path

Reset Grid: Clear all walls and paths.




**How to Use**

Open the application here.

Use the grid to define the Start Node (green) and Destination Node (blue).

Add Walls (black) to create obstacles by clicking on grid cells.

Select traversal options (diagonal or non-diagonal) and a heuristic for A*.

Click Visualize BFS or Visualize A-Star to see the algorithm in action.

Use the Clear Walls button to reset the grid.
