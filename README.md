# Shortest Path Finder 🌟

A **web application** designed to visualize pathfinding algorithms like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **A* (A-Star)**. This interactive tool helps users understand how these algorithms work by providing a customizable grid interface to explore the shortest paths between two points.

---

## Features 

### Pathfinding Algorithms:
-  **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Explores all possible paths layer by layer.
-  **A* (A-Star)**: Combines path cost with heuristics for efficient pathfinding.

### Traversal Options:
-  **Non-Diagonal Traversal**: Moves in four directions.
-  **Diagonal Traversal**: Adds diagonal movements.

### Heuristics for A*:
-  **Manhattan Distance**: Suitable for non-diagonal paths.
-  **Diagonal Distance**: Includes diagonal traversal.
-  **Euclidean Distance**: Uses straight-line distance for calculations.

### Interactive Grid:
- **Add Walls**: Place obstacles to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Start and Destination Nodes**:
  - Start Node: Green
  - Destination Node: Blue
-  **Visualization**:
  - Watch visited nodes and the shortest path animate on the grid.
-  **Reset Grid**: Clear walls, paths, and start afresh.

## How to Use 🎯

1. **Open the application**: [Shortest Path Finder](#).
2. **Define the Start and Destination Nodes**:
   - Green for the starting point.
   - Blue for the destination point.
3. **Add Walls**:
   - Click on the grid to create obstacles (black cells).
4. **Choose Traversal Options**:
   - Select diagonal or non-diagonal movement.
5. **Select A* Heuristic**:
   - Choose Manhattan, Diagonal, or Euclidean distance.
6. **Visualize Algorithms**:
   - Click **Visualize BFS** or **Visualize A-Star** to start.
7. **Reset the Grid**:
   - Use the **Clear Walls** button to reset.
